<p>My name is Nhat Minh Nguyen, but these days I usually go with &ldquo;Nathan&rdquo; living in an English-speaking country. I am from Saigon, Vietnam. I currently live in Brisbane after moving here at the beginning of 2020.</p>
<p>I am expecting to graduate from the <a href=https://www.uq.edu.au/>University of Queensland</a> this December, with a Bachelor&rsquo;s (Honours) degree in Software Engineering.</p>
<h2 id=experience>Experience</h2>
<p>My first ever job was a part-time job as a teaching assistant at a programming school named <a href=https://www.facebook.com/BigOCoding>Big-O Coding</a> in Saigon.</p>
<p>At the end of 2020, I worked for 3 months at a start-up in Brisbane doing mobile development with Flutter.</p>
<p>During my final year at UQ (2021), I did my thesis project at <a href=https://research.csiro.au/qcat/>QCAT - CSIRO</a>. The project was on 3D LiDAR Semantic Segmentation using deep learning methods.</p>
<h2 id=interests>Interests</h2>
<p>After 4 years of doing my bachelor&rsquo;s degree and a lot of contemplating and self-reflecting, I came to the conclusion that I love programming and problem-solving going hand-in-hand. I love solving problems through the means of expressive and concise code, regardless of the programming languages or paradigms. To put it in a somewhat strange manner, I love skill & artistic expressions through code.</p>
<p>My first experience doing computer programming was being introduced to the Pascal programming language in my Computer class at school when I was 13. I was immediately captivated, spending hours at night writing Pascal code solving small programming problems - those that either the teacher handed out, or I came up with myself. When I was about 16, I studied Java and Python on my own.</p>
<p>The topic that fascinated me the most in Computer Science would be classical Algorithms & Data Structures (those that one would find in the CLRS book).</p>
<p>These days, I am quite interested in Compilers and Program Analysis, especially after taking the two courses COMP4403 and CSSE4630 at UQ.</p>
<p>There are topics that I would love to study more in-depth, namely Machine Learning & Statistics, Optimization, Computer Networking & Security, Numerical Analysis, and Cryptography.</p>
<h2 id=programming-languages>Programming Languages</h2>
<p>Programming Languages that I have used quite a lot include C, C++, Java, Python, and TypeScript. I learned some Scala during my last semester at UQ when doing the Program Analysis course, catching a glimpse of what functional programming is about. Scala, Haskell, and Rust are the languages that I plan to study sometime in the future.</p>
<p>I have no strong opinion of which programming language is the best. I am evenly happy to use any language, as long as it is suitable for the job :).</p>
<h2 id=tools>Tools</h2>
<p>I am typically a Linux user. The current daily driver on my main laptop is Ubuntu 20.04 with <a href=https://i3wm.org/>i3</a> window-manager. I myself view using computers, as an activity, somewhat similar to playing instruments (yes, I do play music). Therefore, I can be a bit picky when configuring my own machine, especially in terms of key-mappings. All of my dotfiles can be found <a href=https://github.com/nathan-wien/dotfiles>here</a>.</p>
<p>However, I can work comfortably on any OSes (Windows, Mac) and adapt quickly to any development environment. I have to admit that Windows and Mac have their own upsides when it comes to different kinds of work.</p>
<p>I am a <a href=neovim.io>neovim</a> user. At the same time, I acknowledge that VSCode is a very fine piece of technology, paving the way for the <a href=https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/>Language Server Protocol</a> that allows for real-time auto-completion, linting, and other useful features (without which my neovim experience would not be at great, so thanks VSCode!). I am also a big fan of JetBrains IDEs.</p>
<h2 id=hobbies>Hobbies</h2>
<p>Outside of computer programming, I have other hobbies as well.</p>
<p>I love music.</p>
<ul>
<li>My favorite genre to listen to is Classic Rock (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Vzl0dEtJegEWdtuxeCHMo?si=3284cf2eacbc4a0e">my Spotify playlist</a>).</li>
<li>I play classical guitar when I am not too busy. Some of my favourite classical guitar pieces can be found here <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD0K1bPRzzfG8FaJjLiipOi6iQKRZJmQv">(Youtube playlist)</a>. My favourite classical guitar composer is, of course, TÃ¡rrega.</li>
<li>My favourite piano composers are Liszt and Chopin.</li>
</ul>
<p>I love watching sports. I can watch any kind of sports, from football, to chess, to e-sports. My main motivation for watching sports, besides the sports themselves, is getting to see the personalities of the players shining through.</p>
<ul>
<li>My favourite football club was once Bayern Munich. These days, my favourite player is the Italian <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Chiesa>Federico Chiesa</a>. Most memorable games that I have watched are Germany vs. Italy - World Cup 2006, and Portugal vs. Spain - World Cup 2018.</li>
<li>I would watch all tennis Grand Slams finals if I get to.</li>
<li>My favourite League of Legends player is <a href=https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Rekkles>Rekkles</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I love learning about Psychology. At some point, I was thinking to myself that, had I not chosen to study Computer Science/Software Engineering, Psychology would be a highly-viable choice.</p>
