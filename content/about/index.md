# About me

My name is Nhat Minh Nguyen, but these days I usually go with "Nathan". I am from Saigon, Vietnam. I currently live in Brisbane after moving here at the beginning of 2020.

I am expecting to graduate from the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) this December, with a Bachelor's (Honours) degree in Software Engineering.

## Experience

My first ever job was a part-time job as a teaching assistant at a programming school named [Big-O Coding](https://www.facebook.com/BigOCoding) in Saigon.

At the end of 2020, I worked for 3 months at a start-up in Brisbane doing mobile development with Flutter.

During my final year at UQ (2021), I did my thesis project at [QCAT - CSIRO](https://research.csiro.au/qcat/). The project was on 3D LiDAR Semantic Segmentation using deep learning methods.

## Interests

After 4 years of doing my bachelor's degree and a lot of contemplating and self-reflecting, I came to the conclusion that I love programming and problem-solving going hand-in-hand. I love solving problems through the means of expressive and concise code, regardless of the programming languages or paradigms. To put it in a somewhat strange manner, I love skill & artistic expressions through code. 

My first experience doing computer programming was being introduced to the Pascal programming language in my Computer class at school when I was 13. I was immediately captivated, spending hours at night writing Pascal code solving small programming problems - those that either the teacher handed out, or I came up with myself. When I was about 16, I studied Java and Python on my own.

The topic that fascinated me the most in Computer Science would be classical Algorithms & Data Structures (those that one would find in the CLRS book).

These days, I am quite interested in Compilers and Program Analysis, especially after taking the two courses COMP4403 and CSSE4630 at UQ.

There are topics that I would love to study more in-depth, namely Machine Learning & Statistics, Optimization, Computer Networking & Security, Numerical Analysis, and Cryptography.

## Programming Languages

Programming Languages that I have used quite a lot include C, C++, Java, Python, and TypeScript. I learned some Scala during my last semester at UQ when doing the Program Analysis course, catching a glimpse of what functional programming is about. Scala, Haskell, and Rust are the languages that I plan to study sometime in the future.

I have no strong opinion of which programming language is the best. I am evenly happy to code in any language, as long as it is suitable for the job :).

## Tools

I am typically a Linux user. The current daily driver on my main laptop is Ubuntu 20.04 with [i3](https://i3wm.org/) window-manager. I myself view using computers, as an activity, somewhat similar to playing instruments (yes, I do play music). Therefore, I can be a bit picky when configuring my own machine, especially in terms of keystrokes. However, I can work comfortably on any OSes (Windows, Mac) and adapt quickly to any development environment.

I am a [neovim](neovim.io) user. At the same time, I acknowledge that VSCode is a very fine piece of technology, paving the way for the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) that allows for real-time auto-completion, linting, and other useful features (without which my neovim experience would not be at great, so thanks VSCode!). I am also a big fan of JetBrains IDEs. 

## Hobbies

Outside of computer programming, I have other hobbies as well.

I love music.

* My favorite genre to listen to is Classic Rock ([my Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Vzl0dEtJegEWdtuxeCHMo?si=3284cf2eacbc4a0e)).
* I play classical guitar when I am not too busy. Some of my favourite classical guitar pieces can be found here [(Youtube playlist)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD0K1bPRzzfG8FaJjLiipOi6iQKRZJmQv). My favourite classical guitar composer is, of course, TÃ¡rrega.
* My favourite piano composers are Liszt and Chopin.

I love watching sports. I can watch any kind of sports, from football, to chess, to e-sports. My main motivation for watching sports, besides the sports themselves, is getting to see the personalities of the players shining through. 

* My favourite football club was once Bayern Munich. These days, my favourite player is the Italian [Federico Chiesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Chiesa). Most memorable games that I have watched are Germany vs. Italy - World Cup 2006, and Portugal vs. Spain - World Cup 2018.
* I would watch all tennis Grand Slams finals if I get to.
* My favourite League of Legends player is [Rekkles](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Rekkles).

I love learning about Psychology. At some point, I was thinking to myself that, had I not chosen to study Computer Science/Software Engineering, Psychology would be a highly-viable choice.
