My name is Nhat Minh Nguyen, but these days I usually go with "Nathan" living in an English-speaking country. I am from Saigon, Vietnam. I currently live in Brisbane after moving here at the beginning of 2020.

I am expecting to graduate from the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) this December, with a Bachelor's (Honours) degree in Software Engineering.

## Experience

My first ever job was a part-time job as a teaching assistant at a programming school named [Big-O Coding](https://www.facebook.com/BigOCoding) in Saigon.

At the end of 2020, I worked for 3 months at a start-up in Brisbane doing mobile development with Flutter.

During my final year at UQ (2021), I did my thesis project at [QCAT - CSIRO](https://research.csiro.au/qcat/). The project was on 3D LiDAR Semantic Segmentation using deep learning methods.

## Interests

I love programming and problem-solving going hand-in-hand. I love solving problems through the means of expressive and concise code, regardless of the programming languages or paradigms.

The topic that fascinated me the most in Computer Science would be classical Algorithms & Data Structures (those that one would find in the CLRS book). These days, I am quite interested in Compilers and Program Analysis. There are topics that I would love to study more in-depth, namely Machine Learning & Statistics, Optimization, Computer Networking & Security, Numerical Analysis, and Cryptography.

## Programming Languages

Programming Languages that I have used quite a lot include C, C++, Java, Python, and TypeScript. I learned some Scala during my last semester at uni and tried using it for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/). I plan to study Rust sometime in the future - it looks like a language for me.

I have no strong opinion of which programming language is the best. I am evenly happy to use any language, as long as it is suitable for the job :).

## Tools

The current daily driver on my main laptop is Ubuntu 20.04 with [i3](https://i3wm.org/) window-manager. All of my dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/nathan-wien/dotfiles). At the same time, I can work comfortably on any OSes (Windows, Mac) and adapt quickly to any development environment. Windows and Mac have their own upsides when it comes to different kinds of work.

For text editors, I am a [neovim](neovim.io) user. At the same time, I think VSCode is a very fine piece of technology, paving the way for the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) that allows for real-time auto-completion, linting, and other useful features (without which my neovim experience would not be at great, so thanks VSCode!). I am also a big fan of JetBrains IDEs.

## Hobbies

Outside of computer programming, I have other hobbies as well.

* I love music. My favorite genre to listen to is Classic Rock ([my Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Vzl0dEtJegEWdtuxeCHMo?si=3284cf2eacbc4a0e)). I play classical guitar when I am not too busy. Some of my favourite classical guitar pieces can be found here [(Youtube playlist)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD0K1bPRzzfG8FaJjLiipOi6iQKRZJmQv). My favourite classical guitar composer is, of course, TÃ¡rrega. My favourite piano composers are Liszt and Chopin.

* I love watching sports. I can watch any kind of sports, from football, to chess, to e-sports. My main motivation for watching sports, besides the sports themselves, is getting to see the personalities of the players shining through.

* I love learning about Psychology. At some point, I was thinking to myself that, had I not chosen to study Computer Science/Software Engineering, Psychology would be a highly-viable choice.
